# CleanerCSV

The CleanerCSV project is a tool that reads and cleans CSV files based on a provided JSON specification file. The project performs various cleaning operations such as removing duplicate rows, deleting rows with NA values, stripping whitespace from string columns, replacing characters in specified columns, and reassigning data types for columns. The cleaned data is then saved to a new CSV file. Additionally, the project generates a data profiling report in HTML format for the cleaned data.
